<hr>

## Base Requirements
- Modal popup with detailed info for 251 pokemon
- Responsive Design
- Pokemon API
- Design it to resemble a pokedex from the games
- Animate modal

#### Stretch Tier 1

- Integrate Tabs in modal for selective info display
    Tabs for multiple abilities, moves, sprites
- Integrate Slider on Modal to hop between Pokedex Entries

#### Stretch Tier 2

- Use `localStorage` to cache pokemon data client-side to reduce api calls, and account for it using conditionals at page load
- Use localstorage to cache all sprites using an HTML `canvas` and `dataURL` 
- Initiate caching of all assets in the background using a `worker()`
- Create other pages like AttackDex and ItemDex to utilize Accordion UI/other UI Patterns
